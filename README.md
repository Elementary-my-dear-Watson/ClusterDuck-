ClusterDuck - Social Network API
Description
ClusterDuck is a robust API designed for a social media startup. It allows users to interact with the social network platform, handle large amounts of unstructured data, and seamlessly manage users, thoughts, reactions, and friendships. Built with Node.js and MongoDB, this API ensures smooth operations by syncing Mongoose models with the MongoDB database.

Features
NoSQL Database: Uses MongoDB for handling large, unstructured data in a fast and flexible way.
User and Thought Management: Ability to create, update, and delete users and thoughts.
Reaction Management: Add and remove reactions to thoughts.
Friend Management: Add and remove friends to/from a user's friend list.
Formatted JSON: API GET routes return data in well-structured, readable JSON format.
